## Inspiration

We have always loved history and we have always loved spending time on Wikipedia, learning about historical events. However, there is no real map-interface that allows to learn about the context of historical events across time and with respect to events across the globe. 

We wanted to create an interface that will allow all history-lovers to contribute to historical analysis, while allowing them to learn from the collective knowledge of the human community. 

## What it does

1. Visualizes a particular category of data across time on a map interface (such as Religions or Empires)
2. Allows users to edit the data across time on the map (add new elements, delete elements, edit boundaries, edit information, and more)
3. Allows users to add a new category of data to visualize and add to (such as Languages or Crime Rates)
4. Displays Wikipedia articles on one side which allows users to explore more details about mapped data
5. Displays user inputted information about the data (such as Army size and other facts for Empire data)
6. Visualize multiple categories of data allowing user to choose the combination of categories they wish to see correlation between (such as Religion and Empires at the same time)

## How We built it

- We used ESRI's Javascript API 4.13 for the mapping and visualization.
    - Widgets were used to generate the timeline, data manipulation, and retrieval
- We used ArcGIS for data storage and retrieval of geographical data with a time component
    - FeatureLayers represented categories
    - Features represented individual polygons of data
    - Each feature contained various fields, such as Name, startYear, endYear, information, wikiLink
- We used Vue.js for our front-end
    - Go VUE!

## Challenges We ran into

- 2 of 3 members of our team had to learn Vue.js and was their first hackathon
- 3 of 3 members were not familiar with the ESRI javascript API or the ArcGIS platform
- Storing geo-data along with specific time-encoding, and writing queries for specific periods of time

## Accomplishments that We are proud of

- Accomplishing our original goals of creating a user-editable platform that visualizes historical map data
- Learning Vue.js in one night

## What We learned

- HISTORY!!

## What's next for WikiMaps - Free Online Encyclopedia of Maps

Proposing idea to Jimmy Wales of Wikipedia
Managing our own data with much more scale
Incorporating additional functionality to allow users to gather deeper insights and share more information with the world

Adding lots and lots more history!!
